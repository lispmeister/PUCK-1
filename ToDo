* authentication - right now anyone can connect to a PUCK and just go.  This will change ;)

* authorization - right now anyone can talk to anyone else's PUCK and friend them.  There will be settings for this

* setup wizard - I actually have this all drafted and partially coded,
  but there's a one-page intro that asks you a few questions will be done.

*** status of VPN in a clear, clear way

*** on your puck's details show all the crypto key strength/alg stuff
    (run certitude.sh on all crts, show up in UI)

    * on a connection show the crypto details

    * on other puck's cards show the crypto details


*** creation ipad/etc keys in UI (done in script gen_ovpn.sh)

*** vpn UI fuxx0red

* look at redis log level... should it be notice, warning...?

* pass status via STUN/ICE... even if can't use it initially, will be able to
    see others... plus know their IP

* change ciphers... I think they'll be:

    cipher AES-256-CFB
    auth SHA256

    ... needs more research

* do like a 1 sec ping/heartbeat on VPN connections to be aware of D/C's... 
  show in UI how many secs/mins it's been since your puck has heard from theirs

M * poll other pucks in UI every.... 5s?  10? ...30/60/xxx?

* latency!

* error checking on create - no dups


H * install from git... sigh.

L * openvpn drops connection maybe... starts up 2nd interface... (haven't seen in awhile,
    but still need to check so you don't have multiples running at once)

M * borders/highlighting the one you're talking to - possible:
        outline: 2px solid orange

M * add failure checking when adding pucks

L * quote puck names/whatever for shell $x's... create_puck.sh in particular.

H * need easy disconnect for user

L * when posting/creating puck from form... return success, not errz...!

n/a?  * ... when does a client drop off a OVPN server's link?  Go to tcp?  Check out ping opts ... fixed with tls?

H/? * when adding puck, immediately goes to home, have to refresh... wait for creation (maybe works, maybe not?)

L * Currently... only caller can really hang up :)  (Will repeat, etc.)

L * document - keys in local pucks subdir... for other pucks, they are
     the ones in their (remote) vpn_client subdir

L * don't send all your key stuffs to anyone who asks... only the min to communicate
