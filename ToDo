* ... when does a client drop off a OVPN server's link?  Go to tcp?  Check out ping opts

* when adding puck, immediately goes to home, have to refresh... wait for creation

* fix disabled status button

* fix disconnect on vpn page


* Currently... only caller can really hang up :)

    can server even see signs of no connection?  Timeout?

    hangup seems to be borked on server side (error on hangup popup)

* some hangups kill modal window, but not graying affect on screen

* when kill puck in UI, delete cert dir for it
