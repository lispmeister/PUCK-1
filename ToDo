* kill restify for client, or...?

* bang out ipad/etc keys

* look at redis log level... should it be notice, warning...?

* pass status via STUN/ICE... even if can't use it initially, will be able to
    see others... plus know their IP

* change ciphers... I think they'll be:

    cipher AES-256-CFB
    auth SHA256

    ... needs more research


* on your puck's details show all the crypto key strength/alg stuff
    (run certitude.sh on all crts, show up in UI)

    * on a connection show the crypto details

    * on other puck's cards show the crypto details

* do like a 1 sec ping/heartbeat on VPN connections to be aware of D/C's... 
  show in UI how many secs/mins it's been since your puck has heard from theirs

* latency!

* error checking on create - no dups

* for openvpn need to get the remote IP addr from the logs... or somewhere!

* in/out bound, who is calling/are you calling?

#
# if mucking with files remote system... git pull prob won't work, do:
#
#   git fetch origin master
#   git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD
#

H * install from git... sigh.

M * openvpn drops connection maybe... starts up 2nd interface (tun2)

M * borders/highlighting the one you're talking to - possible:
        outline: 2px solid orange

M * poll other pucks in UI every.... 5s?  10? ...30/60/xxx?

M/H * add who is calling you when you get incoming

M * add failure checking when adding pucks

L * add log watching feature (hard over https?)

M * quote puck names/whatever for shell $x's... create_puck.sh in particular.

H * need disconnect on vpn page

L * when posting/creating puck from form... return success, not errz...!

n/a?  * ... when does a client drop off a OVPN server's link?  Go to tcp?  Check out ping opts ... fixed with tls?

H/? * when adding puck, immediately goes to home, have to refresh... wait for creation (maybe works, maybe not?)

L * Currently... only caller can really hang up :)  (Will repeat, etc.)

L * document - keys in local pucks subdir... for other pucks, they are
     the ones in their (remote) vpn_client subdir

L * don't send all your key stuffs to anyone who asks... only the min to communicate
